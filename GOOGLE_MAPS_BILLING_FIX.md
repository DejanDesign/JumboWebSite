# Google Maps Billing Issue - Quick Fix

## The Problem
You're seeing "This page can't load Google Maps correctly. Do you own this website?" because the Google Maps API key has **billing not enabled**.

## Quick Solutions

### Option 1: Enable Billing (Recommended for Production)
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Select your project
3. Go to "Billing" in the left menu
4. Link a billing account (you can use a free trial with $300 credit)
5. Enable the Maps JavaScript API billing

### Option 2: Use a Free Alternative (Immediate Fix)
I'll update the map to use a free alternative that doesn't require billing.

### Option 3: Use a Different API Key
Get a new API key with billing enabled.

## Current Status
- ✅ Syntax errors fixed
- ✅ Multiple loading issues resolved
- ❌ Billing not enabled on current API key

## Next Steps
1. **Immediate**: The map will show a fallback with working directions
2. **Long-term**: Enable billing or use a free alternative

The website will work perfectly with the fallback map, and all "Get Directions" buttons will still function properly!
